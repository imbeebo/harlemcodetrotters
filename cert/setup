To enable the certificate, you need to insert the following into server.xml:

    <Connector port="8443" protocol="HTTP/1.1" SSLEnabled="true"
              maxThreads="150" scheme="https" secure="true"
              clientAuth="false" sslProtocol="TLS"
       keystoreFile="C:\Users\thege\Desktop\Gonq\CST8218 WEB\ws\Servers\gonqbox"
       keystorePass="Gonq2016" />

Make sure you change the path to keystoreFile. 

I have included a self-signed certificate in this folder.
